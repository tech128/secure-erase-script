# secure-erase-script
Bash script to wipe hdd's and ssd's with many different wipe options, and also allows quick and full verify passes

VERY IMPORTANT: THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT ASK AT ALL TO WIPE A DRIVE ONCE A METHOD IS SELECTED!
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

I mostly created this script to help me wipe the many different drive types I encounter on a regular basis.
I asked about a half dozen ai's to help me with this script and they helped a lot to write most of it.

I did have to make a lot of changes, additions, and tweaks to get it to run properly.

It has only been tested on sata and usb enclosures so far.  I'll test it on a nvme drive when I get a chance.
